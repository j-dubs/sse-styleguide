# Typography

## General guidelines

* Never end a header or label with a full stop \(.\)
* Only use a full stop for sentences, paragraphs and main body copy.
* Always use [sentence case â†—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case). Though our Digital Foundations specify title case for headers and copy, sentence case is more appropriate for the data-heavy products Plasma is designed for.
* Avoid use of all caps wherever possible. Exceptions can be made for buttons.
