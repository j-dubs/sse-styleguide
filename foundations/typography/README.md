# Typography

## General guidelines

* Never end a header or label with a full stop \(.\)
* Only use a full stop for sentences, paragraphs and main body copy.
* Where possible, use [sentence case ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case) for titles, labels & headings. It's more conversational & approachable and reflects how humans communicate with each other – we don’t use title case for texts, emails or letters.
* Avoid use of all caps wherever possible. Exceptions can be made for buttons.
