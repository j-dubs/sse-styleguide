# Buttons

## Labels

Button labels should always be descriptive, action-orientated and short. Try to use a maximum of 2-3 words to convey what each button does.

Button labels are always **Sentence case**.

## Hierarchy

An appropriate hierarchy of calls to action helps to guide users through an interface. Presenting two options with the same visual weighting creates an unnecessary stumbling block for the user. For this reason, we have two styles of button: [primary](https://sse-digital.gitbook.io/ui-styleguide/untitled/button-types#primary-button) and [secondary](https://sse-digital.gitbook.io/ui-styleguide/untitled/button-types#secondary-button).

The primary action should always be presented to the left of the secondary action, or above/below if the buttons are stacked in a narrow column. The two actions should also be visually distinct to avoid creating confusion.

## Spacing

* Buttons have left/right padding of 32px.
* Buttons contained in narrow spaces or displayed on smaller viewports should fill 100% of the width available to them. This helps with cleaner alignment with other elements in that column, and also aligns multiple buttons when stacked.
* If multiple buttons are horizontally aligned, there should be a 25px margin separating them.
* If multiple buttons are stacked vertically, there should be a 16px margin separating them.
