# Buttons

## Labels

Button labels should always be descriptive, action-orientated and short. Try to use a maximum of 2-3 words to convey what each button does.

Button labels are always **Sentence case**.

## Spacing

* Large buttons have left/right padding of 32px.
* Buttons contained in narrow spaces \(e.g. filters\) should fill 100% of the width available to them. This helps with cleaner alignment with other elements in that column, and also aligns multiple buttons when stacked.
* If multiple buttons are horizontally aligned, there should be a 25px margin separating them.
* If multiple buttons are stacked vertically, there should be a 16px margin separating them.
