# Our Core UX Principles

## Design for all

We design our digital services for everyone, regardless of disability or impairment. We always strive to meet WCAG AA standards.

## We do the hard work

Analytics and user-testing shows us how we can improve existing experiences and informs new designs with users at the heart.

## Be human

People aren’t specialists in our products and services, so we shouldn’t speak to them like they are. No jargon or confusing interactions. Just simple, easy to understand language.

## Clarity over clutter

Our digital experiences are designed to be clear and simple to use, nothing un-necessary.

## Drive the action

We aim to guide our customers through clear and easy to understand journeys. Making the action obvious with a clear purpose.
